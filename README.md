# Movie-Recommendation-System-Task
This project builds a content-based movie recommendation system using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLP techniques. It recommends movies based on similarity of genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview.
Features
       Preprocesses raw movie dataset (merged_movies.csv)

       Extracts important features: overview, genres, keywords, cast, crew

       Normalizes text (lowercasing, removing spaces)

       Combines features into a single tags column

       Uses CountVectorizer (Bag of Words) for text vectorization

       Computes cosine similarity matrix between movies

       Provides a recommend() function to suggest top 10 similar movies

       Saves preprocessed dataset and trained model using pickle
Data preprocessing steps 
        Load Dataset â†’ Select required columns (movie_id, title, overview, genres, keywords, cast, crew).

        Handle Missing Values â†’ Remove rows with missing data.

        Parse JSON-like Strings â†’ Convert genres, keywords, cast, crew from stringified JSON to lists.

        Extract Top Features:

                  Top 3 cast members

                  Director (from crew)

        Clean Text â†’ Lowercase, remove spaces, split overview.

        Create Tags Column â†’ Merge overview + genres + keywords + cast + crew.

        Save Preprocessed Dataset â†’ Store as preprocessed_movies.csv.
Model  training 
         Vectorization â†’ Convert tags into numerical vectors using                                      
         CountVectorizer(max_features=5000, stop_words='english').

         Similarity Matrix â†’ Compute cosine similarity across all movie vectors.

         Save Model â†’ Store DataFrame (movies.pkl) and similarity matrix (similarity.pkl).
         Output (sample):
